# Best Buy Bowling Score Keeper
Contains one of two python scripts requested by the Best Buy Recruitment Team.

## Project Summary
bowling_simulator.py can be used to keep track of the score of a bowling game for 2-4 players.

## Demo
The number of players is collected. Only an integer beween 2 and 4 is accepted.

Once the names of players are collected, play continues.
The numbers of pins hit by each roll is collected.
Invalid inputs are rejected.
After each player's turn is completed, their current score is printed.

At the end of the game, the total scores, as well as a frame by frame record of the game is displayed.
